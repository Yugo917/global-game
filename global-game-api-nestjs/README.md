# ü§ñ Code with Generative AI

A step-by-step guide to building a web API in TypeScript using NestJS, assisted by ChatGPT.

## üèÅ Objectives

- **Build a Web API**: Create a scalable and robust web API in TypeScript with NestJS.
- **Learn with AI**: Leverage ChatGPT to implement best practices throughout your API development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

3. **Access the API Documentation**  
   Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/docs](http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/docs) in your browser.

## üìö How to Navigate the Repository

Each development step has its own Git commit and documentation, enabling you to track the evolution of the project:

1. **Track Progress with Git**  
   All major steps are committed, so you can navigate the repo history to understand each stage of the API creation.

2. **Documentation by Step**  
   Each step is documented with its corresponding ChatGPT prompts, which can be found in the `./docs/code-with-ia` folder.

### Development Steps

- **01 - Project Initialization**
