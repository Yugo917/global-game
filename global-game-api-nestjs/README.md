# 🤖 Code with Generative AI with ChatGpt 4

A step-by-step guide to building a web API in TypeScript using NestJS, assisted by ChatGPT.

## 🏁 Objectives

- **Build a Web API**: Create a scalable and robust web API in TypeScript with NestJS.
- **Learn with AI**: Leverage ChatGPT to implement best practices throughout your API development.

## 🧪 Getting Started 
### ⚠️ `The project need to be run on Node V20.9.0`
- Prerequisite :
```
   install node V20.9.0
```
- Follow these steps to set up and run the project:
```bash
   yarn install
   yarn setup-dev-env
   yarn start
   yarn test
```
- Play with It
```
   Open Swagger : http://127.0.0.1:3000/swagger
   Open Kibana : http://localhost:5701
``` 

## 📚 How to Navigate the Repository

Each development step has its own Git commit and documentation, enabling you to track the evolution of the project:

1. **Track Progress with Git**  
   All major steps are committed, so you can navigate the repo history to understand each stage of the API creation.

2. **Documentation by Step**  
   Each step is documented with its corresponding ChatGPT prompts, which can be found in the `./docs/code-with-ia` folder.

### Development Steps

- **01 - Project Initialization**  
  Initialize the NestJS project. [Read more](./docs/code-with-ai/01/).

- **02 - Project Rearrangement**  
  Organize the structure of the API. [Read more](./docs/code-with-ai/02).

- **03 - CRUD & Swagger Integration**  
  Implement CRUD operations and integrate Swagger for API documentation. [Read more](./docs/code-with-ai/03).

- **04 - Add Unit Tests**  
Add test unit for controller and service layer. [Read more](./docs/code-with-ai/04).

- **05 - Add Persitency on MONGODB**  
Add persitency on MONGODB and update the service layer code. [Read more](./docs/code-with-ai/05).

- **06 - Add Integration Tests**  
Add integration test and update and fix code regarding the integration tests. [Read more](./docs/code-with-ai/06).

## ✅ Results 

- A solid NestJs web api with swagger, crud, mongo persitency, resiliency, log etc ...
- MY [Prompt Library](./docs/code-with-ai/00_PromptLib.md) created during the POC
- Other Ai [Use Cases](./docs/code-with-ai/miscellaneous)


## 🎯 Conclusion 

You're no longer just a coder. **You're an architect and reviewer!!!** 🤣💥

Welcome to your new role. **Code less. Review more.**
