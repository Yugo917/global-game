## Request01 (create unit tests):

**Directive 01**: Analyze the entire attached project, focusing only on TypeScript files.

Act as a backend developer experienced in **Node.js**, **NestJS**, and **TypeScript**, specializing in **scalability** and **maintainability** of code. Apply **SOLID** principles, **clean code**, and **clean architecture** practices.

Can you create a unit test file for the following classes `players.controller.ts` , `players.model.mapper.ts` and `players.service.ts` while adhering to the following guidelines:

1. **Mocking Dependencies**:
   - Each injected dependency (via DI) should be mocked using its **interface**, if available. Otherwise, directly mock the class.
   
2. **Atomicity of Tests**:
   - Ensure each test is **atomic** (only one behavior per test).

3. **Test Cases**:
   - Each method should be tested with:
     - **A successful case**.
     - **Two edge cases**.
     - If the method throws specific exceptions, create tests to verify that these errors are correctly thrown.

4. **Test Structure**:
   - All tests should follow the **Arrange, Act, Assert** (AAA) pattern for clear structuring:
     - **Arrange**: Set up the necessary conditions for the test (mock dependencies, prepare data, etc.).
     - **Act**: Execute the action being tested (call the target method or function).
     - **Assert**: Verify that the result matches the expected outcome (compare results, check exceptions, etc.).

   - Follow the example code provided below for structuring and naming tests. Also, adapt the behavior in your tests to properly separate the action from the assertion, particularly in cases of asynchronous methods or when exceptions are expected.

   - For tests like **MyAsyncMethodToTest_WithSpecificUseCase_ShouldThrowExceptionType**, ensure that **the action** and **the assert** are well separated, as shown in `fileSample`.

5. **Test Naming Convention**:
   - Follow the naming convention "MyMethodToTest_WithSpecificUseCase_ShouldSucceed" or "MyMethodToTest_WithSpecificUseCase_ShouldThrowExceptionType," as shown in `fileSample`:

Here is `fileSample`:
```typescript
describe("MyClassToTest", () => {

  test("MyMethodToTest_WithSpecificUseCase_ShouldSucceed", () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });

  test("MyMethodToTest_WithSpecificUseCase_ShouldThrowExceptionType", () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    const action = () => {
      throw new Error("my error");
    };
    // Assert
    expect(() => {
      action();
    }).toThrow("my error");
  });

  test("MyAsyncMethodToTest_WithSpecificUseCase_ShouldSucceed", async () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });

  test("MyAsyncMethodToTest_WithSpecificUseCase_ShouldThrowExceptionType", async () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    const action = async () => {
      throw new Error("my error");
    };
    // Assert
    expect(async () => {
      await action();
    }).toThrow("my error");
  });

});
```

Ensure that test coverage is comprehensive and error cases are properly handled.

# Request 02 enhance the previous responses
**Instructions**: Take your time and generate a detailed response for each file separately.

- **Be exhaustive in use cases**: Ensure that all functionalities of each class are thoroughly tested. Cover a wide range of scenarios, including successful cases, edge cases, and potential failure conditions.
- **Comprehensive testing**: Provide a thorough set of tests for every method in each class, ensuring that all possible behaviors and code paths are validated.
- Clearly structure your response, focusing on one file at a time, and include appropriate explanations for the test scenarios covered.
